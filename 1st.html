                    <h1>Early Life</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory
                        manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's
                        side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic
                        Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.Growing
                        up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age,
                        playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat√≠as, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel
                        Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club
                        Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his
                        maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by
                        her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his
                        goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.
